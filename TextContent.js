    <h2>Why this design?</h2> <br/>
    
    Clean and simple is the name of the game. Mauricia wanted an easy and reliable way for her clients and
    prospects to see what policies and insurance plans maritime offered so that they could make a 
    decision on their own about what direction they'd like to take. <br/><br/>
    
    This frees up a lot of time for 
    Mauricia that would have otherwise been used explaining policies and procedures to clients. Better yet
    it gets the client to sell themselves on the product. <br/><br/>
    
    <h2> How does it work?</h2> <br/>
    
    With minimalism and cleaness in mind, I set out to produce a design that's eye-catching, but not
    distracting. It's clear as soon as a user enters the website what it's about and where they can go
    to get what they're looking. <br/><br/>
    
    This is achieved by using large CTAs (Call To Action) buttons placed exactly after
    a brief introdcution about the purpose of the site. Having only two (2) CTAs eliminates any mental
    paralysis about what the user needs to do to move forward and get their objectives of visiting
    the site met. <br/><br/>
    
    Once they've reached their desired page, a similar process is undergone where they can either read
    up on the services offered by Mauricia, or they can contact her directly through a contact form.
    The website includes subtle, beautiful animations that make it unique from competitor websites, and 
    convey's to prospects the level of quality that would ensue from becoming a client. <br/><br/>
    
    <h2> What was the effect?</h2> <br/>
    
    Keeping the user focused on the original reason for using the site ensures they continue use without distraction
    or frustration that might have occured due to clunkiness. This gets users to complete their objective satisfactorily whilst being happy that they had a great user experience while using a beautiful and easy to use interface. So, the client's are happy and
    Mauricia's happy.<br/><br/>`,

    asymmetry_content: `<h2> Why this design? </h2> <br/>

    A personal project, but none-the-less an experience in developing. Asymmetry was my take in producing
    a user experience that symbolzied opulent travel escapades and what that might look like when being
    planned for in a modern user interface (UI). Bridging the everyday traveler with one in a lifetime 
    experiences is what should be felt upon entry onto the site." <br/><br/>
    
    <h2>How does it work?</h2> <br/>
    
    Users are briefly met with a fluid animation, and hopefully, a sense of awe consumes them on site entry.
    They are quickly met with few, as it should be, actions that they can take, including learning more
    about the travel agency, creating memories, or simply logging in.<br/><br/>
    
    By leaving out noisy visuals or unecessary features and instead greeting users with a simplistic
    design, it is ensured that no hassle or headache ensues, allowing them to get their objectives 
    met in a timely and efficient manner so that planning for their vacaction doesn't feel like a second 
    job. <br/><br/>`,
